# How to setup my Mac guide

## Introduction
This guide will walk through the steps to setup a new Mac for development.

## After first bootup
1. Go throught the initial configuration screens process.
2. Connect to the Wi-Fi network.
3. Log in with my Apple ID.
4. Sync all the things from my iCloud account.

## Once first logged in
1. Remove all the apps I don't want from the Dock and resize it
2. Trackpad settings:
   - Change trackpad speed (up to 3rd most fast speec), and set the clik pression to medium.
   - In the Scroll & Zoom tab, make sure all are checked.
   - In the More Gestures tab: Set the `App ExposÃ©` to `Swipe Down with Three Fingers`.
3. Desktop & Dock settings:
   - Set `Click wallpaper to reveal desktop` to `Only in Stage Manager`.
4. Add Bluetooth to the menu bar.
5. Finder Settings:
   - On the sidebar settings, add the `Home` folder so it will show up in the finder sidebar.
6. Remove heavy apps I don't typically use: GarageBand, iMovie, Numbers, Pages, etc.
7. Open the App Store and install all the updates it prompts.
8. Set the widgets I often use on the notification center:
   - Calendar
   - Weather


## Install most basic Apps
1. Install iTerm2: https://iterm2.com/downloads.html
   - Open it, allow notifications, install required software if it prompts for it, etc.
   - Go to settings, on the `General` -> `Closing` tab, check the `Quit when all windows are closed` option and uncheck all the other ones.
   - Import profile json from this repo [file](./pauvilella_iterm2_profile.json), set it as the default profile and remove the other one.
   - Set it as the default terminal: `iTerm2 -> Make iTerm2 Default Term`.
   - Install the shell integration: `iTerm2 -> Install Shell Integration`.
   - Open a window, we will create a windown arrangement to set as default. Place it with the size and location in the screen where I will want the new windows I open with iTerm2 to be placed. Once we have the position and size correctly set, go to the menu `Window` -> `Save Window Arrangement` and save it with the name *Pau Vilella Arrangement*. I will be set as default since it is the only one. Finally, go to settings, on `General` -> `Startup` tab, and set the `Open Default Window Arrangement` option (leave `Open profiles window` unchecked).

   - Log in with my Google account, so the Default profile will be already logged in.
   - Turn on all Arc Max feautres excepte the `Tidy Downloads` one.
   - Make the toolbar always be visible: `Shift + Command + D`.
